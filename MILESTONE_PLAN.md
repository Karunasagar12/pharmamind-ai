  - Enable fair quality comparisons between different drug formulations (Product 1 vs Product 25)
- Load individual time-series CSV files for real production simulation
- Create production line simulation using different product codes with proper scaling
- Maintain pharmaceutical authenticity - no artificial conversions

**STEP 2: Real-Time Manufacturing Simulation**

"I've built PharmaMind AI - a complete pharmaceutical manufacturing intelligence platform. The core system uses real cholesterol drug manufacturing data from Nature Scientific Data, while the AI module demonstrates cutting-edge quality inspection. This shows both authentic pharmaceutical expertise and innovative technology."

**Demonstration Impact:**
1. **ManuWatch** proves you understand real pharmaceutical manufacturing
2. **VisionQC** demonstrates you can build breakthrough AI technology
3. **Integration** shows you architect complete solutions, not just components

**Strategic Positioning for Lilly:**
"I evaluated existing manufacturing monitoring solutions and selected Spruik/Libre as the proven foundation - showing smart architectural decisions rather than reinventing wheels. Then I customized it specifically for pharmaceutical manufacturing with real cholesterol drug data and integrated cutting-edge AI quality inspection. This demonstrates both enterprise technology assessment skills and advanced customization capabilities."
